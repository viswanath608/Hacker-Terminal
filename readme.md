# Hacker Terminal
This is just a fun project. You can use this site and act in front of your friends as you're an real hacker.
You don't need to do anything, just type what ever you want, it'll automatically display some code.

### Controls You Require To Know
1. **ALT**, If you press ALT key once, "ACCESS GRANTED" message will popup.
2. **CTRL**, If you press CTRL key once, "ACCESS DENIED" message will popup.
3. **Delete/Backspace**, If you want to remove the code, you can either use delete or backspace.
4. **ESC**, Escape key will close the popups.
